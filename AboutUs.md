Hello there!

## Thanks for being interested in us!!

We are a non profit organization based out of BR Hills. We have been up and running since ..Insert year...
We have worked in and around the region on issues related to Education, Conservation and Healthcare. We mainly work on improving the lives of the tribal and rural population in the region and preserving the rich ecosystem of BR Hills.

We believe the most sustainable change and impact is achieved when we work alongside the tribal and rural communities in the region, the government, the forest department and other organizations working on these challenging issues. We continue to collaborate to work on many such high impact [projects](/projects/).

We look forward to working on many such projects in the future. Please feel free to contact us for any collaboration!
